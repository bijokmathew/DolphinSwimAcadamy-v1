                    The Dolphin swim academy introduce a skill or stroke within the early stages of the Learn to Swim Framework.
                Once the skill or stroke has been introduced, these should be continually developed throughout the framework and 
                be mastered alongside the relevant outcomes of each stage.  
            </p>
            <p>
                    The Dolphin swim academy is about building the beginnings of a lifelong love of water.Every child should be 
                given a chance to learn to swim and feel like they are comfortable and able to do so in any situation.We believe 
                that the first experiences during a childâ€™s early years, of water and the pool environment, should be positive, 
                fun and memorable.
            </p>
